# 🌍 Air Quality Management Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard developed to monitor and analyze air pollution levels across different regions over a 4-year period (2019–2022). It helps in visualizing key air quality indicators and comparing pollutant levels geographically and temporally.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Track pollutant trends (PM2.5, CO, NO2) annually.
- Compare regional differences in air pollution levels.
- Identify regions and years with critical air quality concerns.
- Support environmental decision-making through data visualization.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **PM2.5** levels were consistently the highest across all years.
- A sharp **decline in CO levels** occurred after 2019, indicating potential policy or environmental changes.
- **NO2 levels** remained relatively stable and significantly lower than the other pollutants.
- **South** and **West** regions recorded the highest pollution concentrations overall.
- **East** region had the lowest pollutant levels among all regions.

## 📂 Dashboard Features

- 📈 **Line Chart**: Shows pollutant levels by year (2019–2022).
- 📊 **Bar Chart**: Compares pollutant levels across 5 regions (Central, East, North, South, West).
- ✅ **Region Filter**: Allows users to dynamically filter data by region.
